The Smart Energy Forecasting: Predicting Power Demand project focuses on accurately predicting future energy consumption to help utilities and organizations optimize resources, manage supply, and plan for peak demand periods. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the project:

Objective
To develop a predictive system that forecasts energy demand based on historical consumption data, environmental factors, and other influencing variables. The goal is to enable more efficient energy management, reduce costs, and support sustainable resource allocation.

Key Components
Data Collection

Collect historical power usage data from past years, as well as data on temperature, humidity, holidays, and other factors that can impact energy consumption.
Public or organizational datasets, IoT sensors, and weather APIs can serve as sources.
Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values, remove outliers, and scale or normalize data.
Feature engineering is crucial here, as time-based features (e.g., day of the week, seasonality) and weather-related variables significantly impact energy demand.
Model Selection and Training

Using machine learning (e.g., XGBoost) or time series models (like ARIMA, LSTM) to train on historical data and make future predictions.
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation help improve the model's accuracy and ensure generalization to unseen data.
Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate the model with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to gauge prediction accuracy.
Deployment and Real-time Prediction

Host the trained model on a cloud platform like Vultr, where it serves predictions via a backend API (using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI).
The frontend (either a Tkinter desktop app or a web application) interacts with the backend to fetch predictions and display them visually.
Visualization and User Interface

The frontend displays interactive charts or graphs, allowing users to see historical trends and forecasted demand.
This enables users to make data-driven decisions for energy allocation and management.
Benefits of the Project
Operational Efficiency: Helps energy providers and consumers balance supply and demand, preventing overproduction or shortages.
Cost Savings: Reduces unnecessary energy production and helps manage peak demand costs.
Environmental Impact: Supports sustainability efforts by optimizing energy consumption and reducing waste.
